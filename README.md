# VLSI-Design-Labs

Currently working on custom IC designs, including schematic, logic/analog simulation, layout, verification, and post-layout simulation.

## Tools

**EDA Tools**: Cadence Virtuoso (schematic/layout), NC Verilog (logic sim), Spectre (analog sim), Calibre (DRC/LVS/Parasitic Extraction), HSPICE (post-layout sim)
**Technology**: FreePDK45 (45nm CMOS)

## Lab 0 - Inverter (Completed)

- Basic inverter design (schematic & layout)
- Logic and analog simulation
- Physical verification (DRC/LVS)
- Parasitic extraction and post-layout simulation

## Lab 1 - 4-Bit SRAM Memory Cell (In Progress)

**Part A: 4-bit Memory Cell**

- Inverter characterization across input slews and output load capacitances
- 4-bit latch-based memory array with area optimization
- Physical verification

**Part B: 32x32 Memory Array**

- Simulate and measure worst-case access time
- Wire delay modeling/simulation using RC networks
